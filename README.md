# Discriminative-Robust-Local-Binary-and-Ternary-Patterns

This repository contains the MATLAB codes used in my thesis work. Read the individual READMEs in the folders to understand how the codes are to be used. Also, remember to download Piotr's ToolBox which has been modified by me to handle my LBP/LTP changes.
